# MyDairy
This GitHub repository houses my first MVC project, a user-friendly diary application built with C# .NET. With this project, you can seamlessly save, edit, and delete your personal notes. The user interface, a testament to my initial foray into front-end development, provides an intuitive and enjoyable experience for managing your daily thoughts.
